# Desmos Graphing Calculator – Stephen Hawking Visualizations

![Desmos Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Desmos_Logo.svg)

## Overview

Interactive math visualizations using **Desmos** to simplify complex calculus, geometry, and analytical graphing concepts, inspired by **Stephen Hawking’s** work in physics and cosmology.

## Features

* **2D & 3D Graphing** – Explore curves, surfaces, and functions interactively.
* **Dynamic Programming** – Custom scripts for animated and responsive visualizations.
* **Hands-on Learning** – Sliders and inputs help understand functions, transformations, and graph behavior.
* **Stephen Hawking Theme** – Visualizations inspired by black holes, spacetime, and cosmology.

## Getting Started

1. Open [Desmos Graphing Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).
2. Import the project file or copy the graph link.
3. Use sliders and input fields to explore functions and graphs.

## Prerequisites

* Web browser or Desmos app
* Basic knowledge of calculus, geometry, and graphing

## Usage

* Adjust parameters to see real-time graph transformations.
* Explore 3D projections for advanced surface visualization.
* Ideal for teaching, self-learning, or presentations.

## Contributing

* Add new Hawking-inspired visualizations or animations.
* Improve interactivity or enhance graph clarity.
